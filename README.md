# Country POI
This is one of my first full stack projects. It's an webapp that display a country's point of interest. The user can select several countries from the drop-down menu.
Each POI can be clicked and a summary about that POI will be displayed in a pop-up (sourced from wikipedia)
It also displays some information about each country, such as capital, population, flag etc. It has also a built in currency conversion tool and weather forecast.
It was built using leafletJS, wikipedia API, opentrip API. Back-end is PHP

# Functionality and things to consider.
This webApp was built using free API services and it is only intended for learning purposes. If the app doesn't load as expected please try reloadning the page as some of the APIs might fail or take some time to respond.
There are no sensitive data anywhere in the code. As stated before, are all APIs are 100% free and not tiered, hence no effort was made to hide API keys.
